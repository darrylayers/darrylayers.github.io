      <h1>About Darry's Picks</h1>
      <p>
        Hey! What's up? I'm Darryl, the creator of this site.<br />
        One day I realized I was lagging behind on exploring technologies like
        web development, so I decided to build this site to practice my
        skills.<br />
        <br />

        I have spent most of my professional career in software development
        primarily focused on backend systems, databases, and desktop
        development.<br />
        <br />

        I built this website to learn and practice some HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScipt.<br />
        Maybe you will also find some TV shows are movies you are interested in
        as well.<br />
        <br />
        This website uses TMDB to access movie posters and media details like
        summaries.<br />
        It's rather simple, but has helped me improve. Hope you enjoy!
